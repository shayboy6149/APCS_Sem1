            Basics of the game:
            - Given a set of words, the player must memorize the colors
            - After a 5 second delay, the player must type in each color one at a time on separate lines
            - At any point, if they type in an incorrect color, the game ends. The game will print out the correct colors.
            - If they get them all right, the game will continue and add one more word to the series.
            - The series changes every round.
